# Chicago Traffic Safety Analysis: Unraveling Patterns and Predicting Crash Severity

## Introduction

In the bustling city of Chicago, traffic safety is a critical concern impacting the lives of residents every day. The "Chicago Traffic Safety Analysis" project seeks to delve into the patterns and dynamics of traffic crashes within the city, leveraging a comprehensive dataset provided by the City of Chicago. By scrutinizing this dataset, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can contribute to a safer and more informed urban environment.

## Objectives

#### Main Objective
- Identify patterns and trends in Chicago car crashes to gain insights into the dynamics of traffic incidents.

#### Specific Objectives

- Pinpoint specific locations, intersections, or road segments with a high frequency of crashes for targeted interventions.
Evaluate Temporal Influences:
- Examine the impact of time-related factors, such as day of the week, time of day, and seasonal variations, on crash occurrence.
Analyze Contributing Factors:
- Investigate the primary contributing factors to traffic crashes, including driver-related, environmental, and vehicular factors.
Profile Vehicle Involvement:
- Create profiles of vehicles involved in crashes, focusing on types, characteristics, and their correlation with crash severity.
Geospatial Mapping:
- Utilize geospatial analysis to map the distribution of crashes, helping stakeholders understand the spatial dynamics of traffic incidents.


## Business and Data Understanding:

Primary Causes: Identify the primary causes of car crashes in Chicago.
Vehicle Types: Explore the types of vehicles involved in crashes.
Time and Location Patterns: Analyze if there are specific patterns related to time and location.
Severity: Understand the severity of crashes and factors influencing severity.

### Stakeholder Audience:
The stakeholder audience for the Chicago Car Crashes dataset could include various entities such as:
### City Authorities:
Traffic management and law enforcement agencies seeking insights to improve road safety.
### Insurance Companies:
Analyzing patterns to better understand risks and claims.
### General Public:

## Data Analysis and Modeling
#### Predict Severity:
Using features from the dataset to predict the severity of a crash (e.g., minor, moderate, severe).
#### Explore Clusters:
Identifying clusters of crashes with similar characteristics.

### Techniques:
#### Classification Models:
Train models to predict severity (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest).
#### Clustering Algorithms:
Applying algorithms like K-Means to identify groups with similar characteristics.

## Evaluation

Accuracy: Evaluating the accuracy of the severity prediction model.

Cluster Cohesion: Measuring the cohesion within identified clusters.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of the Chicago Car Crashes dataset has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of traffic incidents within the city. The investigation covered various aspects, including crash patterns, high-risk areas, temporal influences, contributing factors, vehicle involvement, geospatial distribution, weather impacts, and the development of predictive models.

In summary, this comprehensive analysis equips stakeholders with evidence-based insights and actionable information to address and mitigate traffic incidents in Chicago. By leveraging these findings, the city can make informed decisions, implement targeted interventions, and work towards creating safer road environments for its residents.
